This is my first web development project, where I had the opportunity to create the website for Relax Hotel.
I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end, while the back end is powered by PHP and MySQL. 
To view the website, please install XAMPP on your device. Once installed, place the project files in the following directory: xampp/htdocs/website.
Then, open your browser and type localhost/relax_register.php to explore the site.
                                               Enjoy! ðŸ˜Š
